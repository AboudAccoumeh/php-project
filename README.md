## Project Overview

This project is a simple web application developed using PHP and MySQL. It provides various features to users based on their authentication status and user roles. The application utilizes a database to store user information and deliver dynamic content.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The project includes a login system that allows users to authenticate themselves using their email and password. Sessions are used to maintain user login state.

- **Dynamic Navigation**: The header section (`header.php`) provides a responsive navigation menu. The active page is highlighted based on the current URL.

- **User Profile**: Once logged in, users can access their profile page (`profile.php`), where they can view and edit their profile information. The profile page displays the user's username and profile picture.

- **Access Control**: The project implements access control based on user roles. Certain pages and features are restricted to authenticated users or users with specific roles, such as administrators.

- **Create Account (Admin)**: Administrators have the ability to create new user accounts by accessing the "Create Account" page (`createAccount.php`). This feature is only accessible to users with administrative privileges.

- **Logout**: Logged-in users can log out of their accounts by clicking the "Logout" link, which terminates their session and redirects them to the login page (`login.php`).
